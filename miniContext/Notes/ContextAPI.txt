1. We will make a Global File to pass the variables bttw the components which is also known as Prop Drilling
2. Context API, Redux, reactRedux, ReduxToolkit, Zustand
3. useContext use hoga

Context API - W3School
1. React Context is a way to manage state globally.

RoadMap from Histesh Sir
1. Create a UserContext

    UserContext.js
        React.createContext() and export

2. Create a UserContextProvider

    UserContextProvider.jsx
        Syntax:
         const UserContextProvider = ({children}) => {
    const [user,setUser] = useState(null)
    
    return(
        <UserContext.Provider value={{user,setUser}}>
        {children}
        </UserContext.Provider>
    )

    :to make sure all the components are aware of the UserContext
    that there is a global state and they can access the data

3. To ensure all the components are aware about the contextAPI
    <UserContextProvider>
      <Login />
      <Profile />
    </UserContextProvider>

4. Consume the Context in the child components



Method 2 : 
Main idea is to change the dark aand light theme in the website 
on toggling the btn the information update to all the components using contextAPI

1. create a js file in a context folder previously haam 2 file bana rahe thy 
   UserContext.js and UserContextProvider.jsx ek context create kr raha tha 
   aur doosra saare component ko aware krwa raha tha but yaha ek file hi bnne gi
